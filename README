[WARNING: This project is not yet ready for proper use. Its very much an alpha at the moment]

*** Installation

$ gem install jsmetric


*** Usage

Cyclometric complexity for a file:
$ ./bin/jsmetric path_to_js_file

Cyclometric complexity for all .js files in a Directory
$ ./bin/jsmetric path_to_dir



*** Backlog/Future Work

- JSLint options are buried in the options.js file. Need to pull these out.
- Refactor the nasty code in the complexity analyser
- Add Debug messages for when a JS file fails JSLint validation
